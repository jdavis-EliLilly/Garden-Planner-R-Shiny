# R Shiny Garden Planner

Garden Planner is a tool to help determine when to plant your garden, how to setup your garden, and provide insights to planting techniques required to maximize your yields. 


## Usage

Enter the expected last frost date for your city. If you do not know please select a city closest to your city and Garden Planner will calculate an expected last frost date for you. 

You can either start adding plants to your custom seed bank from the list provided or provide the size of your garden with the days you are free and Garden Planner will suggest plants that fit your window and garden size. 

## Contributing

Please open an issue to suggest new plants or adjusted planting dates. I would also love to have suggestions on 'level of difficulty' to grow each plant on the current seed bank list.
